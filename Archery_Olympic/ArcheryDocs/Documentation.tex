\section{Introduction}
ArcheryOS is an arch based, rolling release, lightweight pentesting distribution. It uses the default arch linux repositories, to ensure your software is always kept up to date.
\subsection{Philosophy of ArcheryOS}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Minimal

		ArcheryOS is designed to be minimal. It comes preinstalled with i3, which is a minimal window manager (wm) that focuses on utilising as much space as possible.\ i3 has been configured with the goal of minimizing keypresses, and embodying the vim philosophy. ArcheryOS has around 700 programs installed by default, many which are minimal terminal programs, focused on lower system resource useage.

	\item Simple

		ArcheryOS is designed to be simple to use and install, coming with a curses installer to simplify the usual arch installation process.

		\emph{Please note the installer is an offline installation program, simply copying all installed programs to the HDD\. Please update after installation}
	
	\item Privacy

		ArcheyOS has been configured with privacy in mind. Firefox has been configured to minimize any data leaks that may identify the user, such as browser fingerprinting and WebRTC IP leaks. 
		
		You can visit \href{https://www.privacytools.io/}{privacytools} for more information.

		You can also visit \href{https://panopticlick.eff.org/}{panopticlick} to check your browser fingerprint and \href{https://www.privacytools.io/webrtc.html}{privacytools webrtc check} to check for WebRTC IP leaks.

\section{i3}
\subsection{Introduction to i3}
``i3 is a tiling window manager, completely written from scratch. The target platforms are GNU/Linux and BSD operating systems, our code is Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) under the BSD license\. \i3 is primarily targeted at advanced users and developers.'' --- \textcite{i3wm}

\subsection{keybinds}
``Mod'' is a reference to the super key, what is known as the ``Windows key''.

\section{Known bugs and issues}
\subsection{Screen size}
When first starting ArcheryOS in virtualbox, the screen size will be quite small. To fix this just logout and log back in again (\textbf{Mod+Shift+s} then \textbf{e}).
\subsection{Ranger image preview}
The default file manager in ArcheryOS, ranger, does not preview images when loaded in virtualbox. I have not found anyway to fix this, as of yet.

\subsection{Found more bugs?}
If you have found bugs or have any issuse with ArcheryOS, please submit an issue to \href{https://github.com/H0ll0wp0int/ArcheryOS-build-files}{the ArcheryOS github repo}.
